2. **Today**: Test all extracted components thoroughly
3. **This Week**: Complete ProfileScreen extraction
4. **Next Week**: Begin Phase 4 (Custom Hooks)

**Investment Required**: 2-3 hours for QuizScreen extraction
**Expected ROI**: 600 lines removed from App.js, 80% Phase 3 complete

---

## üöÄ **NEXT PHASE PREVIEW**

**Phase 4 Goals**: Extract custom hooks from App.js, create reusable logic
**Timeline**: 3 days (January 11-13)
**Success Metrics**: 5 custom hooks extracted, App.js reduced to ~3,000 lines
